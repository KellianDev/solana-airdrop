# Solana airdrop by KellianDev

This script was created to airdrop a list of solana accounts with a specified amount of solana.

## How to use

### 1. Install and build

The simplest way to use it is to clone the repository and to run:
```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Configure

You can then modify the configuration in the ```.env``` file:<br>
`SECRET_KEY`: This is the secret key of the account that will run the airdrop<br>
`RPC_URL`: This is the RPC connection that will be used to run transactions<br>
`ACCOUNT_LIST_PATH`: This is the path to the list of account that you are airdropping (.json)<br>
`AMOUNT`: This is the amount (in â—Ž) each account will be airdropped.<br>

### 3. Airdrop

After configuring your airdrop session, just run:
```bash
npm run airdrop
```

### 4. More

When transactions fail or script is stopped in the middle of an airdrop session, the remaining addresses are saved in the ```cache.json``` file. That means you can rerun the script and it will detect that the airdrop is not complete and resume the previous session.
